### Paw Patrol Pervasive Game

Pervasive games depict a world created at the junction where reality and fiction meet. The environment of a pervasive game is established by a two-way dynamic whereby the game becomes heavy with the reality of life, and life becomes charged with the meaning of the game.

Paw Patrol is an interactive gaming experience augmented by technology. It is enabled by mobile and web technologies and played at Goldsmith's library. Many aspects of this experience are extended into the real world, aiming for its players to interact with the game and their environment in embodied ways. 

The web-based game system employs four technologies. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used for the front end and PHP for the back end. A promotional webpage, a game lobby page, five mission pages with automated validation and a voting page were created using these. PHP is also used for database administration tasks such as setting up a new game with role assignment, a results table page, and validating Mission 4, the completion of which needed to be checked manually due to the gameâ€™s pervasive nature.
